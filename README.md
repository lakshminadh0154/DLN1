In this program, we start by defining an array of numbers. We then create an empty array called divisibleByThree to hold the numbers that are divisible by 3.

We then loop through each element in the numbers array using a for loop. For each number, we check if it is divisible by 3 using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder of the division is 0, then the number is divisible by 3, and we push it to the divisibleByThree array.

Finally, we print the divisibleByThree array to the console using console.log().
